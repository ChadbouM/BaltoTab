Installation:

    The Installation tool generated with Visual Studio Installer projects
    ‘BaltoInstaller.exe’ can be run to Automatically install the program which
    can then be run from the start menu.

Keys:

    While BaltoTab is running and the GUI is inactive:
        """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
        | Alt+Q            :    activate GUI    |
        """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
    While BaltoTab GUI is Active:
        """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
        | W                :    selector-up     |
        | A or Tab         :    selector-left   |
        | S                :    selector-down   |
        | D                :    selector-right  |
        | Q or Enter       :    select          |
        | E                :    alternate-select|
        | ALT+Z            :    close           |
        """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Uses:

    Using WASD to move the target-selector, windows are brought to focus with
    the select key; or focused using the alternate-select key. A focused item,
    can be repositioned using the WASD keys, and placed in ‘Decks.’

    New decks can be created using the select key while targeting the ‘+’ symbol
    in the middle row; the content of the selected deck can be manipulated using
    the bottom row. Windows are positioned in decks by focusing them and
    repositioning them on top of the desired deck’s icon or directly into the 
    intended position in the bottom row.

    When a deck is selected using the primary-select key, the windows contained
    within it are brought to focus with descending priority from left to right.
    So that the left most windows will be on top of all the other windows.

    When you have finished using BaltoTab use the ‘close’ command to Exit, (by 
    default this is ALT+Z.)

Known Bugs and Solutions:

    After using the GUI for the first time, key presses are not captured
    properly and system-pings begin to play on key-press. This can only be
    stopped by closing BaltoTab using the close command, or ending the process
    ‘BaltoTab’ through the Task-Manager (Ctrl-Shift-Esc.)

Windows 10 Port:

    “Although Windows 10 has virtual desktops, I’m going to work towards
    shifting this into a windows 10 app as a learning exercise because
    Windows 10 is now my Primary OS at home.” - Author
